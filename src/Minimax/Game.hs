-- ================================ Monad Par ================================
{-
Explore the tree in parallel with monad par. There's no lazyness, so no
alpha-beta pruning on that and this degrades performances a lot. To cope with
this problem parallelism threshold is kept at 1 because sequential tails does
apply alpha-beta pruning. Of course this limit parallelism to the number of
moves that can be done from a certain situation, but in tic-tac-toe few moves
means few turns left so the computation is fast anyway (even without
parallelism).

Probably a better implementation should decide the threshold dynamically
considering the number of processors and the number of moves.
